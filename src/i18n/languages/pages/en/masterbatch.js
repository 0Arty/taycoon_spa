This can be done either immediately before production or before pre-mixing the plastic. The amount of super concentrate to be added depends on the specific requirements of the final product. Typically, the standard level of colourant addition ranges from 1% to 5%, but this can be adjusted to suit the needs of a particular project or manufacturer",
