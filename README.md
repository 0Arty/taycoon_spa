The design was developed by me.
The project was created in a short period of time and in the future I want to convert it to Next.js to improve SEO optimization. 

A lot of time has passed and I see a lot of mistakes in this project - so this is an additional point why I want to redo it.

To launch a website in development mode, you need to download the repository to your computer from the gitHub. Open it with VsCode or webStorm and install the packages with the command 
```npm i``` or ```npm install``` 

```npm start``` - starts local hosting and development mode 
```npm run build``` - create a build of the website.
